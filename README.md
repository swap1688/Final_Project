# Breast_Cancer_Prediction
## IRONHACK Final Project
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, representing the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics

The dataset I have used in this repo is publicly available and was created by Dr. William H. Wolberg, physician at the University Of Wisconsin Hospital at Madison, Wisconsin, USA. link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

 - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
 - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
 - perimeter
 - area
 - smoothness 
 - compactness 
 - concavity 
 - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
 - symmetry
 - fractal dimension 
Through this features one can predict the tumor is either Malignant(cancer causing) or Benign(normal tumor) using machine learning

# Notebook
The notebook provides a step-by-step guide on loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
The model's performance and evaluation metrics will be displayed in the Jupyter notebook. You can expect to see accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for both the training and testing datasets.
